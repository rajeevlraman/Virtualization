<h2>👨‍💻 Virtualization Platforms</h2>

***The Virtual Box*** environmet is setup with three different topoplogies. One is based on the topology and older machines used in the Holmesglen Netlab activities. the second lab is b ased on a SIEM Security Information and Event Management perspective. This lab was built to simulate a SOC analyst environment to conduct all sorts of log monitoring and analysing various attacks which is carried out by Kali Linux from an internal network and outside the network. the third lab was a openvpn lab, built with openvpn.<br><br>
***The Proxmox lab*** environment is built to understand the baremetal server environment and various linux based installations. It is a general lab environment with a SOC analyst perspective and to understand the Proxmox platform.<br><br>
***The Hyper-V Lab*** environment is built again to understand the platform and aslo to experiment with various windows scenarios. I have used this lab most extensively to setup and manage Domain Controller, Active Directory services, IIS(Internt Information Services) Web server, and Microsoft Exchange server. windows 11 and Office 365 Deployment Lab kit is a wonderful lab to learn a lot on deployment and configuration services.<br><br>
