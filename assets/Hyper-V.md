**Microsoft Hyper-V**

Microsoft Hyper-V is a native hypervisor included in Windows Server and Windows 10/11 Pro, Enterprise, and Education editions. Microsoft offers various VMs and Lab kits for education in its evalauation centre. It allows users to create and manage virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical machine. Here are its key features, pros, and cons:

**Features:**
- **Type 1 Hypervisor:** Hyper-V is a bare-metal hypervisor that runs directly on hardware, providing high-performance virtualization.
- **Integration with Windows:** Seamless integration with Windows Server and Windows desktop operating systems, including management through PowerShell and GUI tools.
- **Virtual Machine Migration:** Live migration of VMs between Hyper-V hosts without downtime, using shared storage.
- **Hyper-V Replica:** Built-in disaster recovery solution for replicating VMs to a secondary site over a network link.
- **Hyper-V Manager:** Centralized management console for configuring, managing, and monitoring VMs and host servers.
- **Snapshot and Checkpoints:** Ability to take snapshots of VMs for backup or testing purposes, and checkpoints for rollback.
- **Secure Boot and Shielded VMs:** Support for Secure Boot and Shielded VMs to protect VMs from unauthorized access.

**Pros:**
- **Native Integration:** Integrated into Windows Server and Windows client editions, providing familiar management interfaces and seamless integration with Windows ecosystem.
- **High Performance:** As a Type 1 hypervisor, Hyper-V offers excellent performance and resource utilization.
- **Scalability:** Supports large-scale deployments and enterprise-level virtualization scenarios.
- **Active Directory Integration:** Integration with Active Directory for authentication and authorization of VM access.
- **Backup and Disaster Recovery:** Built-in features like Hyper-V Replica and backup solutions ensure data protection and business continuity.

**Cons:**
- **Windows Ecosystem Dependence:** Limited to Windows-based environments, which may be a consideration for mixed-platform environments.
- **Resource Consumption:** Requires significant system resources, especially RAM and CPU, for optimal performance.
- **Complexity:** Setting up and managing Hyper-V can be complex, especially in clustered or large-scale environments.
- **Licensing Costs:** Licensing costs may apply for Windows Server editions that include Hyper-V, though Hyper-V itself is free on Windows 10/11 Pro and Enterprise editions.
